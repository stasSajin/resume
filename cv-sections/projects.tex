        \item {A neural network trained on baby expressions and spliced videos using EfficientNet as the architecture backbone. The model is pruned extensively using the Lottery Ticket hypothesis technique in order to speed up inference performance}
        \item {Developed a pipeline for active labeling, so that the model trains as video streams are labelled}
		\item {Several cameras inside the household are used to stream the video feed through RSTP to the model}
